# Coding-Quiz-Game

## Description 
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI coding Bootcamp. This coding quiz was created to test your knowledge on javascript terminology. The game will run once the start button is clicked and will prompt the users with 10 different questions with multiple choice. Note that if an answer is answered wrong -  15 seconds will be deducted from the time/score as penalty. See how much time you have left and try to answer the questions as fast as you can.
Here is a screenshot of the functioning home page.
